        <h3><b>Lirik Lagu Lucky by Jason Mraz:</b></h3>
        <p> Do you hear me, I'm talking to you <br>
            Across the water across the deep blue ocean <br>
            Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying<br><br>
            Boy, I hear you in my dreams<br>
            I feel your whisper across the sea<br>
            I keep you with me in my heart<br>
            You make it easier when life gets hard<br><br>
            Lucky I'm in love with my best friend<br>
            Lucky to have been where I have been<br>
            Lucky to be coming home again<br>
            Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br><br>
            They don't know how long it takes<br>
            Waiting for a love like this<br>
            Every time we say goodbye<br>
            I wish we had one more kiss<br>
            I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will<br><br>
            Lucky I'm in love with my best friend<br>
            Lucky to have been where I have been<br>
            Lucky to be coming home again<br>
            Lucky we're in love in every way<br>
            Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed<br>
            Lucky to be coming home someday<br><br>
            And so I'm sailing through the sea<br>
            To an island where we'll meet<br>
            You'll hear the music fill the air<br>
            I'll put a flower in your hair<br><br>
            Though the breezes through the trees<br>
            Move so pretty you're all I see<br>
            As the world keeps spinning round<br>
            You hold me right here right now<br><br>
            Lucky I'm in love with my best friend<br>
            Lucky to have been where I have been<br>
            Lucky to be coming home again<br>
            I'm lucky we're in love in every way<br>
            Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed<br>
            Lucky to be coming home someday<br><br>
            Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
            Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</p>
